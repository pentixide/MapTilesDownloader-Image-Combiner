# MapTilesDownloader-Image-Combiner
There's probably already a tool for this somewhere or even with the downloader, but I haven't looked.
I haven't tested further than my one map, but I'll be sure to investigate if there's issues.
Be sure not to put any extra PNGs in the folder as my script doesn't care and doesn't check anything.

Be sure to set the path to the folder one lower than the folder with the metadata.json
This was my path.
'~/MapTilesDownloader-master/MapTilesDownloader-master/src/output/1666706237350/15'

The final image will be shown and save one folder higher than your path.
